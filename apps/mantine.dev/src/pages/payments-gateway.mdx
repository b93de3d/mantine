# Payments Gateway

## Feature overview

## Providers

Here are just a few of the payment providers we currently have integrated:

Additional providers can also be integrated rapidly where needed. 

## Integration Overview

<IntegrationSteps />

## Create a payment session

> **You will need**
> - An API Key
> - The URL of your BookieBase instance (e.g. https://yourbrand.bookiebase.ie/api/)
> - In production, you will need to ask us to whitelist the IP addresses from which API requests are made

Create a new payment session via a `POST` request to the `/payment_sessions` endpoint:

```python
# Python Example

import requests

res = requests.post(
    "https://yourbrand.bookiebase.ie/api/payment_sessions",
    headers={"Authorization": "Token [YOUR_API_KEY]"},
    json={
        "customer": {
            "unique_id": "123",         # Unique customer identifier
            "first_name": "John",
            "last_name": "Jones",
        },
        "payment": {
            "unique_id": "P-0001",      # Your unique identifier for the session
            "payment_type": "DEPOSIT",  # DEPOSIT or WITHDRAWAL
            "amount_cents": "1000",     # Â£10
            "currency": "GBP",
        },
        "session_config": {
            "success_redirect_url": "https://yoursite.com/payment/result",
            "failure_redirect_url": "https://yoursite.com/payment/result",
            "webhook_url": "https://api.yoursite.com/webhooks",
        },
    },
)

result = res.json()     # { "payment_session": { "url": "https://yourbrand.bookiebase.ie/payment/[PAYMENT_SESSION_UUID]" } }

```

## Embedding the Payment Session

Redirect the customer to the payment session url or embed the hosted payments page in an iframe:

```html
<iframe
    src="https://yourbrand.bookiebase.ie/payment/[PAYMENT_SESSION_UUID]"
></iframe>
```

Try it out: [Gateway Embedding Example](https://eg.gateway.bookiebase.ie/)

## Handle Session Result

If the session results in a successful payment, we will redirect the customer to the
specified `success_redirect_url`. If the session is cancelled or fails, we will redirect the
customer to the `failure_redirect_url`.

## Webhooks

A webhook event will be sent to the configured `webhook_url` each time the payment sessions
status changes.

Webhooks are sent as POST requests to the specified `webhook_url`.
The body of the request contains JWT encoded data as a UTF-8 string.
This data should be decoded using the HS256 algorithm with your webhook secret as a key.
The resulting JSON object contains the updated payment session:

```json
{
  "payment_session": {
    "uuid": "611748d8-8d3a-4066-a72a-1fd24c72dff1",
    "customer": { "account_id": "9999G", "currency": "GBP" },
    "order_reference": "B4KFoQ2Ufk",
    "payment_type": "DEPOSIT",
    "amount_cents": 1000,
    "payment": {
        "status": "COMPLETE" # PENDING | COMPLETE | FAILED,
    },
  }
}
```

```python
# Python Example

import jwt

WEBHOOK_SECRET = "INSERT_WEBHOOK_SECRET"

def handle_webhook(self, request):
    decoded_data = jwt.decode(
        jwt=request.body.decode("utf-8"),
        key=WEBHOOK_SECRET,
        algorithms=["HS256"],
    )
    print(decoded_data["payment_session"]["uuid"])
    return ...
```

> **Webhook Retries**
> 
> If we do not receive a HTTP Status 200 response from the configured webhook endpoint within 10 seconds, 
> the request will be considered to have failed. We will retry the webhook up to the specified number of
> `max_webhook_retries`. We strongly advise that you put in place handing of duplicate notifications, 
> in case of unexpected errors occurring on either side.
